Coverage in programming is how much of our code is covered by tests. We can use the “-cover” flag to run coverage
 analysis on our code. We can use the flag and required file name “-coverprofile <some file name>”
 to write our coverage analysis to a file.

--to execute coverage at console
    go test -cover ./...

--create a file.out to track the coverage by actions, and it is parsed by the browser
    CMD command:
        go test -coverprofile cout
    CMD command:
        go tool cover -html=c.out

-- invoke go tool help
    CMD command:
        go tool cover -help
